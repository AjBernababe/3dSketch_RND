- Raycaster is for handling mesh events with cursor
- onHover has to be called inside render function because Raycaster updates
- In the window resize handler, I did not use the windowResize event listener itself. 
  Instead, I always compared the window size to the canvas size to avoid potential issues within CEFSharp.
